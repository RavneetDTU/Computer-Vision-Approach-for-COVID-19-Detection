# Computer Vision Approach for COVID-19 Detection

## Abstract
COVID-19 is spreading rapidly throughout the world. As of 22nd June 2020, 475K people died due to the diseases, while the total number of infections was 9 Million worldwide. The respiratory system is part of the human body, which is most affected by the diseases. In this project, we propose an architecture named COVID Detector with novel residual blocks for detecting COVID-19 disease using X-Ray Images. Along with the paper, we also released a dataset consisting of 13,990 chest X-Ray images of COVID- 19 patients, Pneumonia patients and Normal chest X-Ray Images. The proposed architecture outperforms the conventional Residual Structures on the released dataset. It can help doctors, as of today, X-Ray images are used by the doctors in postmortem to determine COVID-19 as a cause of death. The use of chest X-Ray may prove to be a more efficient way than the thermal screening of the human body, and with our model, the screening process can become more reliable and faster.
